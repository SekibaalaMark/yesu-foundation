          <h2></h2>
          <p>Praise the name of the living God. My name is Betty, teacher by profession born in Luwero district. And this is my journey with Yesu Foundation and
this a testimony of life.
With Uncle Father Paul and Rev Mom Damalie I believe the scripture that says, "He leaves the 99 for the one..." and God came through for us through the
Yesu Foundation family. I joined Yesu Foundation in  2018 while I was in my last year of Highschool (O'level) and my life didn't remain the same in an unprecedented
time.</p>
          <p>Spiritually, I learnt a lot, got to know much more about God, and how to pray. Above all,I was able to walk through battles through prayer.
I discovered some talents didn't know I had like Singing and I am a worshipper of God. Like a youth there always I used to conduct myself
thinking that the order but all changed with their counsel and I became something I never imagined I would be. Basically, During my O'level
they impacted a lot through prayers, effort, counsel and wishes they both shared enabled me reach University and I am now a graduate still walking
the journey of marriage and life and salvation with them.
Uncle father and Mom, I thank you for the unselfishness, loving heart, considerate and for willing to give so much of yourself. May God's face shine
on you forever.</p>

          <h2>Derrick's story</h2>
          <p>I'm Derick Alimani Ajuni, and I'm forever grateful for the life-changing encounter I had with Mr. Zziwa Paul in 2011 during my high school days. Our bond grew stronger in 2012 when he volunteered with Compassion Uganda and introduced me to the piano, marking the beginning of a beautiful mentorship that shaped my spiritual journey. Under his guidance, I discovered the joy of serving God and grew in my faith through attending night prayers and exploring ministry. The Zziwa family, including his loving wife Rev. Damalie Zziwa, has been a constant source of encouragement, supporting me throughout my studies and ministry endeavors. Their love and care played a significant role in my journey, enabling me to graduate as a secondary teacher and pursue community work with AVA Mission Africa. I'm now part of the Smart Band Gulu, and I'm hopeful for the future. The Zziwa family's love, kindness, and generosity have been a true blessing, and I'm grateful for their influence, praying that God continues to bless them abundantly.</p>
