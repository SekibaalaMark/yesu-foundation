          <h2></h2>
          <p>Praise the name of the living God. My name is Betty, teacher by profession born in Luwero district. And this is my journey with Yesu Foundation and
this a testimony of life.
With Uncle Father Paul and Rev Mom Damalie I believe the scripture that says, "He leaves the 99 for the one..." and God came through for us through the
Yesu Foundation family. I joined Yesu Foundation in  2018 while I was in my last year of Highschool (O'level) and my life didn't remain the same in an unprecedented
time.</p>
          <p>Spiritually, I learnt a lot, got to know much more about God, and how to pray. Above all,I was able to walk through battles through prayer.
I discovered some talents didn't know I had like Singing and I am a worshipper of God. Like a youth there always I used to conduct myself
thinking that the order but all changed with their counsel and I became something I never imagined I would be. Basically, During my O'level
they impacted a lot through prayers, effort, counsel and wishes they both shared enabled me reach University and I am now a graduate still walking
the journey of marriage and life and salvation with them.
Uncle father and Mom, I thank you for the unselfishness, loving heart, considerate and for willing to give so much of yourself. May God's face shine
on you forever.</p>

          <h2>Transforming Education in Lukomera</h2>
          <p>The Lukomera Community School was struggling with inadequate facilities, limited teaching resources, and low enrollment rates. Many children in the community were not attending school regularly due to these challenges.</p>
          <p>In 2021, YESU FOUNDATION partnered with the school to improve educational outcomes for children in the community. We renovated classrooms, provided teaching materials, and implemented teacher training programs.</p>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>"The transformation of our school has been remarkable. With better facilities and resources, our teachers are more motivated, and our students are eager to learn. School attendance has improved significantly." - Headteacher, Lukomera Community School</p>
          </div>
          <p>Today, the school has seen a 40% increase in enrollment and a significant improvement in academic performance. The school now serves as a model for other schools in the region.</p>
          <p>This success story demonstrates how our community-based approach to education can create lasting change for entire communities, not just individual children.</p>
